## Why this project?

While building my first Freecodecamp's React project, Random Quote Machine, I realised the project was identical to the Master Coder PP's project from Academia de CÃ³digo (Bootcamp). He used HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

After finish the Freecodecamp project on Codepen, I reused the code to rebuild PP's project in React.

Besides turning the project into React app, I added more quotes and author to the project. I Also did some CSS adjustments.
